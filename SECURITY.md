# Security Policy

## Scope

This policy covers all repositories under the **venantvr-crypto** organization. These projects deal with cryptography, blockchain technologies, and wallet implementations.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in any of these repositories, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not open a public issue.** Security vulnerabilities must be reported privately.
2. Go to the affected repository's **Security** tab and click **"Report a vulnerability"** to create a private security advisory.
3. Include as much detail as possible: affected files, steps to reproduce, and potential impact.

## What We Consider Security Issues

- Private key exposure or leakage
- Weak or broken cryptographic algorithms used in production contexts
- Wallet address manipulation or fund redirection
- Hardcoded secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Dependencies with known CVEs

## Response

- Acknowledgment within **72 hours**
- Status update within **7 days**
- If confirmed, a fix will be prioritized and you will be credited (unless you prefer anonymity)

## Out of Scope

- Archived repositories (kept for reference, not actively maintained)
- Educational or demo code clearly marked as such
- Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies that are already publicly disclosed — please check existing CVEs first
